## Overview

DecodeMyCode is an AI-powered tool that bridges the gap between complex code and clear understanding. It generates plain-English explanations and customizable flowcharts to make any code instantly comprehensible. This blueprint outlines the plan for creating a modern and intuitive landing page that reflects the project's identity.

## Current Plan

### Landing Page UI

The goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page that effectively communicates the value of DecodeMyCode.

**Design:**

*   **Theme:** Dark theme, suitable for developer tools.
*   **Layout:** A clean, modern, and responsive layout.
*   **Key Sections:**
    *   **Hero Section:** A prominent section with a catchy headline, a brief description of the tool, and a primary call-to-action.
    *   **Core Functionality Section:** A section showcasing the main feature of the application, with a code editor on one side and a placeholder for the explanation and flowchart on the other.
    *   **Features Section:** A section highlighting the key features of the tool, such as line-by-line explanations, code summaries, and visual flowcharts.
    *   **"Who is this for?" Section:** A section dedicated to the target audience, including students, educators, and development teams.
    *   **Footer:** A footer containing project context and other relevant links.

**Technology:**

*   **Framework:** React with Vite.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first CSS workflow.
*   **Components:** The UI will be built using a component-based architecture to ensure reusability and maintainability.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Clear Existing UI:** Remove the boilerplate code from `App.tsx` and `index.css`.
2.  **Create Component Structure:** Create a new directory `src/components/landing` to house the landing page components.
3.  **Develop Components:** Create individual components for each section of the landing page:
    *   `Hero.tsx`
    *   `Features.tsx`
    *   `Audience.tsx`
    *   `Footer.tsx`
4.  **Style Components:** Use Tailwind CSS to style the components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.
5.  **Assemble the Landing Page:** Integrate all the components into `App.tsx` to create the complete landing page.
